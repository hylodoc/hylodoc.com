	<h1>Blogging for programmers</h1>
	<p>
	We're building <a href="https://xr0.dev">Xr0</a> and enjoy blogging about it.
	</p>
	<p>
	Static-site generators like Jekyll and Hugo are powerful but lack reader-interaction features such as subscriber emails, metrics and so on. There's nothing wrong with this &mdash; they're literally called <em>static</em>&hyphen;site generators &mdash; but we want more.
	</p>
	<p>
	Substack, on the other hand offers great interactivity, but isn't built for programmers. It has poor support for code: no syntax highlighting and the inline code rendering is <span class="substack-code">jarring</span>. Plus, we want to manage our blog posts as text files with Git.

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Markdown and git first:</strong> Generate sites from Git repos. Markdown files are pages and code looks beautiful. Simply push your changes to a configured branch to apply changes to your site.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Separation of form and content:</strong> No custom CSS &mdash; pick a <a href="/theme">theme</a> and start writing.<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Batteries included:</strong> Email lists, metrics, custom
				domains, one&hyphen;click subscriber export are
				built-in. Prefer plaintext emails? We got you
				covered.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Open source:</strong> Both the platform and SSG are open
				to the community.
			</li>
		</ul>
