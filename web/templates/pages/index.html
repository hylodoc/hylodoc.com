	existing SSGs (like Jekyll and Hugo) are extremely powerful but
	lack features for interacting with readers, such as comments,
	subscriber emails, metrics and so on. there's nothing wrong
	with this &mdash; they're literally called
	<em>static</em>&hyphen;site
	generators &mdash; but we want more.
	</p>
	<p>
	on the other hand, although Substack is nice, it isn't built for
	programmers.
	there's very poor support for code: no syntax highlighting and
	the inline code rendering is
	<span class="substack-code">jarring</span>.
	we also want to treat our blog posts like text files and manage
	them with Git.

		<ul>
			<li>
				it generates blog sites from Git repos.
				Markdown files are pages and code looks
				beautiful.
			</li>
			<li>
				it separates form from content like LaTeX.
				no need for custom CSS.
				pick a <a href="/theme">theme</a> and start
				writing.<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				some &#128267;&#128267; included like comments,
				email lists, metrics, custom domains, RSS,
				one&hyphen;click exporting of all data.
				every page can be downloaded as a
				LaTeX&hyphen;typeset PDF.
				plaintext emails are available to make your
				hardcore-programmer readers respect you.
			</li>
			<li>
				the SSG is open source, but the batteries
				are for paying subscribers.
